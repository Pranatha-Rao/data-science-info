The folder "data2" contains all the files related to the assignment.

Part 1.ipynb contains code for the two questions:

1. I have a drug group and a placebo group. I want some quantitative confirmation to see if they produce the same or different outcomes: drug-A and placebo-A.

2. I have a drug group and a placebo group: drug-B and placebo-B. The mean outcome is lower in the placebo group and I have a theory that may explain this, but I first need to rule out the possibility that the lower outcome is just due to chance.
