    "[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is the American version of a popular global banking game known as **Twenty-One**, whose relatives include *Pontoon* and *Vingt-et-Un*. It is a comparing card game between one or more players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer. Players do not compete against each other, they compete against the dealer. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the *most widely played casino banking game in the world*.\n",

    "\n",
    "Players are each dealt two cards, face up or down depending on the casino and the table. In the U.S., the dealer is also dealt two cards, normally one up (exposed) and one down (hidden). In most other countries, the dealer only receives one card face up. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one *or* eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands. A hand with an ace valued as 11 is called \"*soft*\", meaning that the hand will not bust by taking an additional card. The value of the ace will become one to prevent the hand from exceeding 21.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once all the players have completed their hands, it is the dealer's turn. The dealer hand will not be completed if all players have either busted or received *blackjacks* (=21). The dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit (draw another card) until the cards total up to 17 points. At 17 points or higher the dealer *must* stay (at most tables the dealer also hits on a \"*soft*\" 17, i.e. a hand containing an ace and one or more other cards totaling six). You are betting that you have a better hand than the dealer. The better hand is the hand where the sum of the card values is closer to 21 without exceeding 21. The detailed outcome of the hand follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the player is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card (called a \"*blackjack*\" or \"*natural*\"), and the dealer does not, the player wins and usually receives a bonus.\n",
    "- If the player exceeds a sum of 21 (\"*busts*\"); the player loses, even if the dealer also exceeds 21.\n",
    "- If the dealer exceeds 21 (\"*busts*\") and the player does not; the player wins.\n",
    "- If the player attains a final sum higher than the dealer and does not bust; the player wins.\n",
    "- If both dealer and player receive a blackjack or any other hands with the same sum, called a \"*push*\", *no one* wins.\n",

    "Now let's say that you want to know the value of holding a hand of 15 while the dealer is showing, let's say, a 10. This is an example of a **prediction** problem. Each time the agent carries out action A in state S for the first time in that game, it will calculate the reward of the game from that point onwards. By doing this, you can determine how valuable it is to be in that current state.\n",

Now that computation is fast and clever algorithms like Metropolis and NUTS are available, Bayesian estimation is the *preferred* way to do statistics, even to compute something like a p-value!"
